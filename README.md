## The Origin

I find myself very fascinated by the blockchain space and eagerly looking for ways to contribute with skills that are more natural to me. 

I am not an artist, and while I recognize the financial implications of the blockchain - I do not feel that is where my development impact lies in the space. I do not have a background in finance. I AM a gamer tho :)

## The Goal
This project will take place in a number of phases, as I am learning Unity alongside many of the gaming integrations of the blockchain simultaneously - my experience entering this project lies in C/C#/C++ and in Autonomous Vehicles, particularly image processing and sensor integration. 

By the end of this project, the goal is to have an RPG game that is: familiar in feel, unique/organic in mechanics, and uses DLL imports or similar plugins to integrate Rust smart contract and RPC calls into the C# game environment. 

### Phase 1
**Learning Unity**

In order to learn Unity, I have purchased a course on Udemy. I am familiar with the platform, having used it to learn ROS (Robotics Operating System), and enjoy the variety of courses to choose from to find the best one for you. I am following [Learn to Create a 2D RPG Game](https://www.udemy.com/share/101CSc3@6Ue5f5YnbTWRGm2Vu7spVdaN-JAuPPh7rYofi-YJgDBuprzP3x5ADD5qCLBjAAiN/). Once I have learned substantially, I will investigate acquiring my own assets and adding some blockchain/NFT related functions. 

### Phase 2
**Building Game Features that require the blockchain**

After I've built out some core functionality for the game following the tutorial, I will explore ways to include the blockchain. This could include: 
- Player profile/team information read from NFT Metadata
- Framework for on-chain player accounts (stored as NFT account info?) and game state saves used in pve (maybe pvp) interactions = pluggable into other unity games?
- In-game payments (FRICTIONLESS & not marketplace extractive)
- In-game messaging system that extends outside of the game environment using on-chain messaging ideas, protocols, or techniques
- Ability to send game state info to friends that is non-reliant on player account info

### Phase 3
**Integrating the Blockchain into our game**

This comes the fun stuff - writing scripts to handle some of these unique game feature ideas in Rust and import those as C# scripts in Unity to attach to GameObjects.

### Phase 4
**Upgrading and Iterate**

Once we have a basic game working with a few blockchain features integrated and some fun playable modes, its time to refine. Make better games/challenges. Source better assets. Make cooler mechanics. Iterate. Things to consider: 
- Update art assets to original assets that expand the capabilities of our game
- Update the stack with Unity Mobile modules? [Solana Mobile Stack](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-mobile-stack-sdk)
- Add NFT infrastructure around the Player Accounts that enables ecosystem expansion
- Integrate social media sign-ons to share game achievements, offer in-game incentives/events tied to social interactions, in-game art clips as banners, PFPs, Phone Wallpapers, etc. 
- Explore 3D engines???
